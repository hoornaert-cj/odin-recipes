    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
       Not recommended for novice chefs, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a difficult to make and doesn't taste all that good, but we are
       recommneding that you make one anyway. Involving bread of some sort, peanut butter of some sort, and jelly of some sort, this dish will
       fill your stomach and help you survive until your next (hopefully more delicious) meal.
